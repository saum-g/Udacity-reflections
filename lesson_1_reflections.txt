How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?



    Old code was correct, so one of the changes had to be the source of error


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?



    Error finding would be easier, plus parts of the old code which were rejected may be useful later

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



    Pro: Logical changes can be tracked Con: It might create a problem if we forget to save after a critical change



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



    Google docs isn't meant for software development, while Git is; and this is necessary for it


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?



    git log will give us the list of all versions of the file we have created and git diff will help differentiate between various versions so that the changes can be tracked easily



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?



    In case a major mistake is done, it can be reverted back



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?



    Hmmm...
